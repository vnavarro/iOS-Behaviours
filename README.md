#Behaviours in iOS

This project is a sample of using behaviours in iOS.

As I improve on the idea of behaviours in iOS, then I may get back here to create more samples.

The idea of building this sample project started from my readings on Design Patterns and articles like [objc.io behaviours](http://www.objc.io/issue-13/behaviors.html)

If you have thoughs on this and want to collaborate on this project please just use Pull Requests, I'll be glad to sum up new ideas. If you just want to discuss about or don't want to do a PR just reach me through dev dot vitor dot navarro at gmail dot com.
